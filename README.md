Intro:
We are in an era where theres too many diseases are going around and most of them being contagious. Its very easy to get one of these and this project aims at reducing the effects of it. With introducing an image dataset of diseases, the machine can learn to identify them and provide a brief description of the respective disease to the user when scanning at a physical symptom. By doing so, we can reduce the time between getting the actual symptom, and coming in contact with a doctor to actually cure the disease and it could also save costs.
Aim:
Create an image dataset to recognise different physical symptoms of diseases.
Working:
While scanning the physical symptoms, the machine automatically recognises the disease and recommends the nearest doctors. This helps in saving time and money. We also came up with an idea of adding an GPS element to it which would collect the trending health news from social media and so on and it would help people keep up with the "most common" disease in their area. Theres also the possibility of selling the database to other programmers or developers who are in need of datas for their machines.
Conclusion:
Implementing this would help the healthcare sector massively and in turn would also help the economy of the country.
